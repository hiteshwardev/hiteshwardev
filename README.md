## About Me  
I’m a **Physics major** deeply drawn to the intersection of mathematics, computation, and real-world problem-solving. My passion lies at the crossroads of **Computational Sciences**—where physical theories meet computational models—and **Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning**, particularly in building systems that learn from data and reason about complex phenomena.

I’m driven by the challenge of **applying computational and AI-driven approaches to tackle real-world problems**, from simulating natural systems to developing intelligent models that complement first-principles understanding. My goal is to bridge theoretical insight with practical implementation—turning equations into code, and ideas into impact.

Whether it's through physics-informed machine learning, scientific computing, or statistical modeling, I aim to contribute to solutions that are both grounded in theory and scalable in practice. I believe the future belongs to those who can **think critically, compute efficiently, and learn continuously**.
