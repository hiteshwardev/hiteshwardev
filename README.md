# 👋 Hello World, I'm Hitesh Kumar Singh  
### aka **Hiteshwardev** ⚡

## 🧠 About Me
I’m a **Physics major** with a deep interest in **Computational Sciences**, where mathematics, physics, and computation collide.  
Equally fascinated by **Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning**, I enjoy exploring how data-driven models can complement first-principles scientific thinking.

I believe the future belongs to those who can **bridge theory with computation** — and that’s exactly the space I’m building myself in.
